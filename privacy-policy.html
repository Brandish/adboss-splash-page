                <h1>Advertising</h1>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Interest-Based Advertising.</span> We use "interest-based" advertisements, also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of the technologies we use as described more fully below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources.</span> Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Do Not Track.</span> Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Your Privacy and Ad Choices.</span> The entire purpose of our app is to serve you targeted advertising, and by downloading this app, you have indicated your consent to interest-based advertising and its associated data collection.  Nevertheless, what we present here are the standard opt-out functionalities for mobile apps and websites.  You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive through the Digital Advertising Alliance mobile app, available in the iOS and Android app store as well as at the following site:  <a id="about-ads" href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices/">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>.

                    </script>
                      Some of our functionality may rely on your mobile browser, in which case, you may wish to additionally consider the following opt-out: <a id="about-ads-choice" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
